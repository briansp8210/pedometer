# pedometer

Implement a simple pedometer following the elaborate article: [A Pedometer in the Real World](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-pedometer-in-the-real-world.html). This is my term project for NCTU nsd 2020 autumn.

### Usage

```
python3 pedometer.py <FILE>
```

`FILE` is a csv file with acceleration information capturing by [Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrystianvieyra.physicstoolboxsuite&hl=zh_TW&gl=US). This program currently only supports this App.
